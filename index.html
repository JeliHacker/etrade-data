  <h1>E-Trade Data Visualization</h1>
  <p>I have been using E-Trade to invest in the stock market for a few years now.
    I wanted to be able to see how my portfolio was doing relative to how much money I had invested.
    Using E-Trade API and data from E-Trade, this is what I was able to create.</p>
